I really hope these activists don't free Billy, 'cause out there in the wild, I'd be dead. The sight of bloodworms put him in a feeding frenzy, Now it means that it's time to clean the pool.

It can't be all coincidence Too many things are evident You tell me you're an unbeliever Spiritualist? well me I'm neither But wouldn't you like to know the truth Of what's out there to have the proof And find out just which side you're on Where would you end in Heaven or in Hell? Help me, help me to find my true Self without seeing the future Save me, save me from torturing Myself even within my dreams There's got to be More to it than this Or tell me why do we exist I'd like to think that when I die I'd get a chance another time And to return and live again Reincarnate, play the game Again and again and again and again"}

Had I listened to the grapevine, I might have had my doubts. But I did my level best Just to block them out. Cause love is so unwise And love has no eyes, And it took a while For a fool to see What his friends were on about. I was a fool to care, I was a fool to care, I was a fool to care, But I don't care even If I was a fool I'm still in love with you. Imagining your face, It almost fills The empty space before me. I can see your eyes And almost hear your lovely lies. I wish I was an old man And love was through with me. I wish I was a baby on my mama's knee. I wish I was a freight train Moving down the line, Just keeping track of time Without all these memories I was a fool to care, I was a fool to care, I was a fool to care, But I don't care even If I was a fool I'm still in love with you, babe, yes, I am. I could have opened my eyes, I could have seen through your lies, I could have stood for no more, I could have walked out the door. But I was a fool to care, I was a fool to care. But I was a fool to care, I was a fool to care. You weren't nothing but a fool to care, Just a country fool to care. You weren't nothing but a fool to care, Just a country fool to care."}

Now you can't see a thing ... And I feel no pain -- Singing about the Valley of Sunsets Green and blue ... Canyons too Singing about Atlantis love songs. The Valleys of Neptune is arising. 2. Mercury liquid ... Emerald's shining Telling me where I came from -- Honey Sun ... Pourquise Bed he lays in -- ... on the Burning edge Horizon. I'm sailing on the Bluebird's mission ... Bubble and curls and tiptoes in the foam -- See the wind make love to all the ocean ... Joy spread and the massage got home -- Singing about the Valley of Sunsets ... Purple and gold ... the Armies of the Lord Before ancient Egypt, there were moon trips ... The Valleys of Neptune is arising -- 3. Look out East coast, but you're gonna have a neighbor, A rebirth land ... the praying Burning Sands. We know there were worlds so much older ... And they shall rise, and tell us much more the truth of man -- 4. I see visions of sleeping peaks erupting ... releasing all hell that will shake the Earth from end to end -- And this ain't bad news, good news, or any news ... it's just the truth, Better save your souls while you can -- Singing about the New Valleys of the Sunrise ... Rainbow clean, the world is gonna be ... Singing about getting ready for the new tide ... The Valleys of Neptune is arising."}

If you feel dissatisfaction, Strum your frustrations away. Some people may prefer action, But give me a folk song any old day. The tune don't have to be clever, And it don't matter if you put a couple extra syllables into a line. It sounds more ethnic if it ain't good English And it don't even gotta rhyme... (excuse me: rhyne!) Remember the war against Franco? That's the kind where each of us belongs. Though he may have won all the battles, We had all the good songs! So join in the folk song army! Guitars are the weapons we bring To the fight against poverty, war, and injustice. Ready, aim, sing!"}

{"artist":"Bob Dylan","song":"Arthur Mcbride","lyrics":"Oh, me and my cousin, one Arthur McBride, As we went a-walkin' down by the seaside, Mark now what followed and what did betide, For it bein' on Christmas mornin' Now, for recreation, we went on a tramp, And we met Sergeant Napper and Corporal Vamp And a little wee drummer intending to camp, For the day bein' pleasant and charmin'. Good morning, good morning, the Sergeant he cried. And the same to you, gentlemen, we did reply, Intending no harm but meant to pass by, For it bein' on Christmas mornin' But, says he, My fine fellows, if you will enlist, Ten guineas in gold I'll stick to your fist, And a crown in the bargain for to kick up the dust, And drink the king's health in the morning. For a soldier, he leads a very fine life, And he always is blessed with a charming young wife, And he pays all his debts without sorrow or strife, And he always lives pleasant and charmin', And a soldier, he always is decent and clean, In the finest of clothing he's constantly seen. While other poor fellows go dirty and mean, And sup on thin gruel in the morning. But, says Arthur, I wouldn't be proud of your clothes, For you've only the lend of them, as I suppose, But you dare not change them one night, for you know If you do, you'll be flogged in the morning, And although that we're single and free, We take great delight in our own company, We have no desire strange places to see, Although that your offers are charming. And we have no desire to take your advance, All hazards and dangers we barter on chance, For you'd have no scruples for to send us to France, Where we would get shot without warning, Oh no, says the Sergeant. I'll have no such chat, And neither will I take it from snappy young brats, For if you insult me with one other word, I'll cut off your heads in the morning. And Arthur and I, we soon drew our hogs, And we scarce gave them time to draw their own blades When a trusty shillelagh came over their head And bid them take that as fair warning. And their old rusty rapiers that hung by their sides, We flung them as far as we could in the tide, Now take them up, devils! cried Arthur McBride, And temper their edge in the mornin'! And the little wee drummer, we flattened his bow, And we made a football of his rowdy-dow-dow, Threw it in the tide for to rock and to roll, And bade it a tedious returning, And we havin' no money, paid them off in cracks. We paid no respect to their two bloody backs, And we lathered them there like a pair of wet sacks, And left them for dead in the morning. And so, to conclude and to finish disputes, We obligingly asked if they wanted recruits, For we were the lads who would give them hard clouts And bid them look sharp in the mornin'. Oh, me and my cousin, one Arthur McBride, As we went a-walkin' down by the seaside, Mark now what followed and what did betide, For it bein' on Christmas mornin'"}

He was better off dead, than slow in the head. His momma and poppa hadtaken a ride on his back, so he left very quickly to join The Pack. I see faces and traces of home back in New York City - So you think I'm a tough kid? Is that what you heard? Well I like to see some action and it gets into my blood. The call me the trail blazer - Rael - electric razor I'm the pitcher in the chain gang, we don't believe in pain 'Cause we're only as strong, yes we're only as strong, As the weakest link in the chain. Only after a spell in Pontiac reformatory was he given any respect in thegang. Let me out of Pontiac when I was just seventeen, I had to get it out of me, if you know what I mean, what I mean. You say I must be crazy, 'cause I don't care who I hit, who I hit. But I know it's me that's hitting out and I'm, I'm not full of shit. I don't care who I hurt, I don't care who I do wrong. This is your mess I'm stuck in, I really don't belong. When I take out my bottle, filled up high with gasoline, You can tell by the night fires where Rael has been, has been. Now, walking back home after a raid, he was cuddling a sleeping porcupine. That night he pictured the removal of his hairy heart and to the accompanimentof very romantic music he watched it being shaved smooth by an anonymousstainless steel razor. As I cuddled the porcupine He said I had none to blame, but me. Held my heart, deep in hair, Time to shave, shave it off, it off. No time for romantic escape, When your fluffy heart is ready for rape. No! Off we go... Your sitting in your comfort you don't believe I'm real, You cannot buy protection from the way that I feel. Your progressive hypocrites hand out their trash, But it was mine in the first place, so I'll burn it to ash. And I've tasted all the strongest meats, And laid them down in coloured sheets (laid them down in coloured Sheets). Who needs illusion of love and affection When you're out walking the streets with your mainline connection? Connection. As I cuddled the porcupine He said I had none to blame, but me. Held my heart, deep in hair. Time to shave, shave it off, it off. No time for romantic escape, When your fluffy heart is ready for rape. No!"}

{"artist":"Keith Green","song":"Summer Snow","lyrics":"Unexpectedly, you came back to see, If Id was waiting, like I promised long before. Your shadow filled the room, the music changed its tune, When I saw you, you were standing at the door. Like summer snow, you were an unexpected sight. A blazing sun, you were shining in the night, When I really should have known, that youd be coming home. I waited patiently, but I found it hard to see, If you were coming, why was there such a long delay. At times I thought you lied, or else you would have tried, To let me know that you were coming home today. Like summer snow, it falls around me in the cold. I can hear the echoes, of the warnings I was told. That I should know, that youd be coming home. Like summer snow, you were an unexpected sight. A blazing sun, you were shining in the night, When I really should have known, that youd be coming home. Unexpectedly, you came back to see..."}

{"artist":"Reba Mcentire","song":"Fancy","lyrics":"I remember it all very well lookin' back It was the summer I turned eighteen We lived in a one room, rundown shack On the outskirts of New Orleans We didn't have money for food or rent To say the least we were hard pressed Then Mama spent every last penny we had To buy me a dancin' dress Mama washed and combed and curled my hair And she painted my eyes and lips then I stepped into a satin Dancin' dress that had a split on the side clean up to my hip It was red velvet trim and it fit me good Standin' back from the lookin' glass There stood a woman where a half gown kid had stood She said here's your one chance Fancy don't let me down Here's your one chance Fancy don't let me down Mama dabbed a little bit of perfume on my neck And she kissed my cheek Then I saw the tears wellin' up in her troubled eyes When she started to speak She looked at a pitiful shack And then she looked at me and took a ragged breath She said your Pa's run off and I'm real sick And the baby's gonna starve to death She handed me a heart shaped locket that said To thine own self be true And I shivered as I watched a roach crawl across The toe of my high heel shoe It sounded like somebody else that was talkin' Askin' Mama what do I do She said just be nice to the gentlemen Fancy And they'll be nice to you She said here's your chance Fancy don't let me down Here's your one chance Fancy don't let me down Lord forgive me for what I do, but if you want out Well it's up to you Now don't let me down you better start movin' uptown Well, that was the last time I saw my Ma The night I left that rickety shack The welfare people came and took the baby Mama died and I ain't been back But the wheels of fate had started to turn And for me there was no way out And it wasn't very long 'til I knew exactly What my Mama's been talkin' about I knew what I had to do but I made myself this solemn vow That I's gonna be a lady someday Though I don't know when or how I couldn't see spending the rest of my life With my head hung down in shame you know I might have been born just plain white trash But Fancy was my name Here's your one chance Fancy don't let me down Here's your one chance Fancy don't let me down It wasn't very long after a benevolent man Took me off the street And one week later I was pourin' his tea In a five room hotel suite I charmed a king, a congressman And an occasional aristocrat Then I got me a Georgia mansion In an elegant New York townhouse flat And I ain't done bad Now in this world there's a lot of self-righteous hypocrite That would call me bad And criticize Mama for turning me out No matter how little we had But though I ain't had to worry 'bout nothin' For nigh on fifteen years I can still hear the desperation in my poor Mama's voice ringin' in my ear She said, here's your one chance Fancy don't let me down Here's your one chance Fancy don't let me down Lord, forgive me for what I do But if you want out well it's up to you Now don't let me down Your Mama's gonna help you uptown I guess she did"}
